# Steps API

## Current State

**Shipped:** v3.3.0 (Orchestration L3 → L1 → L2 Build Pipeline) — 2026-05-29 · [milestone archive](milestones/v3.3.0-ROADMAP.md)
**Previously:** v3.2.0 (Steps API MVP) — 2026-05-28 · [milestone archive](milestones/v3.2.0-ROADMAP.md)

On top of the v3.2.0 CRUD foundation, v3.3.0 added the orchestration build pipeline: `POST /api/v1/orchestration/start` fetches each requested workflow graph from Postgres (L3), builds a transient in-memory `WorkflowGraphSnapshot` (L1), validates it (existence → cycle → schema-edge → payload-config-schema; 422 + RFC 7807 at the first failed gate), and projects it into 3 Redis (L2) keyspaces that external consumers read. Stop is a Redis existence gate with GET-and-follow cleanup. Redis is a soft compose-stack dependency (Phase 5 HEALTH contracts untouched); closes v2-deferred VALID-21 at orchestration-start scope; no new SQL entities or columns. 235/235 integration facts GREEN × 3 consecutive runs against real Postgres + Redis + ES + Prom, dual-SHA (`psql \l` + `redis-cli --scan`) BEFORE=AFTER held. 64/64 requirements satisfied (milestone audit PASSED).

v3.2.0 delivered the reusable `BaseApi.Core` library + runnable `BaseApi.Service` exposing CRUD over 5 entities (Schema, Processor, Step, Assignment, Workflow) + 3 junctions against Postgres 17 in Docker Compose; OpenTelemetry logs → Elasticsearch, metrics → Prometheus, no traces (Phase 11 D-03); RFC 7807 + `X-Correlation-Id` end-to-end; three K8s-style health probes with migration-gated readiness.

_Active milestone: v3.4.0 (BaseConsole + Orchestrator Messaging) — started 2026-05-30. Phase 17 (Messaging.Contracts + Shared L2 Root Extract) complete: leaf contracts library with frozen vocabulary + moved L2 root read-shape, MassTransit 8.5.5 CPM-pinned; 235×3 GREEN, dual-SHA BEFORE=AFTER held. Phase 18 (BaseConsole.Core Library) complete: reusable Generic-Host base mirroring `BaseApi.Core` — console-flavored metrics-only OTel (no TracerProvider), soft-dep Redis, embedded minimal-Kestrel health probes (`/live` dep-independent, `/ready` flips on bus-started, `/startup` gate), `AddBaseConsole` root + `AddBaseConsoleMessaging` bus skeleton, and the three bus-wide correlation filters; validated standalone with 10 in-memory Console tests, 245×3 GREEN, dual-SHA BEFORE=AFTER held. CONSOLE-01..05, CONSOLE-HEALTH-01..04, CORR-01/02 satisfied. Phase 19 (Orchestrator Console + WebApi Bus Wiring + RabbitMQ Tier) complete: runnable `Orchestrator` console (instance-unique temporary/auto-delete fan-out endpoint, body-carried `ICorrelated.CorrelationId` read at the inbound filter, read-L2→seam-log, business-ack/infra-throw split with `UseMessageRetry(Immediate(3))`+`Ignore<WorkflowRootNotFoundException>`); WebApi publish-only bus join (`AddBaseApiMessaging`, bus health capped at Degraded, Start/Stop publish with a fresh `NewId` body CorrelationId, dependency firewall to `Messaging.Contracts` only); `rabbitmq:4.1.8-management-alpine` compose tier + multi-stage `Orchestrator` Dockerfile — live stack operator-verified healthy (sk-rabbitmq + sk-orchestrator). 5/5 success criteria verified in source; ORCH-CON-01..04, MSG-WEBAPI-01..04, MSG-ACK-01..04, INFRA-RMQ-02/03 satisfied. One human-UAT item (live cross-process correlation proof) deferred to Phase 20's E2E harness. Phase 20 (correlation proof + synthetic harness + triple-SHA closeout) remains — milestone NOT complete (3/4 phases)._

## Current Milestone: v3.4.0 BaseConsole + Orchestrator Messaging

**Goal:** Stand up a reusable `BaseConsole.Core` Generic-Host library (the console-side mirror of `BaseApi.Core`) and a first `Orchestrator` console that inherits it, connected to the web API over MassTransit/RabbitMQ, with automatic CorrelationId propagation proven end-to-end (HTTP → Redis L2 → fan-out message → orchestrator correlated log in Elasticsearch).

**Target features:**
- **`BaseConsole.Core`** library — Generic Host bootstrap (`AddBaseConsole`/`RunAsync`), OTel logs+metrics to the collector (console-flavored: MEL-bridge logs + runtime + MassTransit instrumentation, no AspNetCore instrumentation), Redis client (lifted from `BaseApi.Core`), embedded minimal-Kestrel health probes (`/health/live|ready|startup`, ready flips when the MassTransit bus has started), and a MassTransit bus skeleton (`AddBaseConsoleMessaging`).
- **Correlation propagation in `BaseConsole.Core`** — inbound consume filter (correlationId → AsyncLocal accessor + `"CorrelationId"` MEL log scope, reusing the OTel `IncludeScopes` key) **and** outbound send/publish filter (stamps the ambient correlationId onto every `ICorrelated` message). Outbound side exercised this milestone via a test-harness synthetic downstream send.
- **`Messaging.Contracts`** shared assembly (referenced by WebApi + Orchestrator) — `StartOrchestration{WorkflowIds[]}` / `StopOrchestration{WorkflowIds[]}` control contracts (no correlationId on the wire), the `ICorrelated` mandatory-field vocabulary `{ CorrelationId, ExecutionId, WorkflowId, StepId, ProcessorId, EntryId }`, and the read-side L2 root shape extracted from `BaseApi.Service` so WebApi writes it and Orchestrator reads it from one source of truth.
- **`Orchestrator`** console — inherits `BaseConsole.Core`; consumes Start/Stop on an instance-unique fan-out queue → reads the L2 root per WorkflowId → extracts the stored X-CorrelationId → establishes a correlated log scope → logs up to the "scheduler job start" seam → ack-on-success. No Redis writes, no Quartz this milestone (logs are the deliverable).
- **WebApi messaging** — joins the bus; Start/Stop fan-out (publish to instance-unique queues) to all Orchestrator replicas (1 today, topology supports N); RabbitMQ is a hard dependency for the Start/Stop path only (CRUD surface unaffected).
- **RabbitMQ** added to the compose stack.

**Key context / locked decisions:**
- Topology: fan-out (WebApi→Orchestrator control) = each replica binds an **instance-unique queue**; load-balanced send (`queue:processorId`, shared results queue) is future.
- CorrelationId reconciliation: HTTP `X-Correlation-Id` (string) stays on the HTTP edge and inside the Redis L2 root value; the bus-world `Guid CorrelationId` is minted by the Quartz scheduler per trigger (**future**) — the two do not unify, they are linked via logs.
- Out of scope this milestone (deferred to the **Processor milestone**): Quartz scheduler, the `Processor` concrete, the live orchestrator→processor→orchestrator round-trip, the concrete `JobTrigger`/`ExecutionResult` records, and the processor self-id-by-SourceHash request/response + its WebApi responder.
- Still-deferred prior candidates (unchanged): FUTURE-STOP-EVICTION, FUTURE-OTEL-REDIS, FUTURE-GENERATION-ID, FUTURE-VALID-21-HTTP-WRITE, v2 hardening (TEST-03/04, INFRA-09/10, HTTP-17/18/19, auth boundary). FUTURE-SCHEDULER is partially addressed here (the Orchestrator scaffold) but the scheduler itself remains future.

## What This Is

A .NET 8 Web API platform that exposes CRUD over a workflow-engine data model — Schema, Processor, Step, Assignment, Workflow — built as a modular monolith on top of a reusable base library (`BaseApi.Core`) that future entities can plug into without rewriting infrastructure. The service ships logs to Elasticsearch and HTTP/runtime metrics to Prometheus via an OpenTelemetry Collector, runs against PostgreSQL via Docker Compose, and exposes RFC 7807 Problem Details on every error. Consumers (external Orchestrator + Scheduler) read Workflow entities to drive scheduled data-processing pipelines.

## Core Value

**A solid, observable, validated CRUD foundation that future workflow-platform features build on without rework.** If everything else fails, the base must reliably persist entities, validate inputs, emit telemetry, surface clean errors, and answer health probes. **Validated at v3.2.0 ship — base components were re-used 5× without rewrite for the 5 v1 entities; Phase 10 demonstrated that field-shape revisions land as bisect-friendly 5-commit sequences without infrastructure churn.**

### Active

**Milestone v3.4.0 (BaseConsole + Orchestrator Messaging) — defining requirements (started 2026-05-30).** See the "Current Milestone" section above for goal, target features, and locked decisions. Requirements are being scoped into `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`; the roadmap continues phase numbering from v3.3.0 (last phase 16 → this milestone starts at phase 17).

### Out of Scope

- **Authentication / authorization** — not in v1; service is open. `CreatedBy`/`UpdatedBy` populated only when `HttpContext.User.Identity.Name` is available; otherwise null. *Why: unspecified in milestone scope; will be added when an auth boundary is defined.*
- **Orchestrator / scheduler logic** — external systems consume `WorkflowEntity.CronExpression` and the workflow graph. The webapi is CRUD only. *Why: explicitly out of scope per user.*
- **Workflow execution engine** — running a workflow, tracking runs, retries, parallelism. *Why: external responsibility.*
- **`WorkflowScheduleEntity`** (originally listed) — removed; control is per-workflow via `CronExpression` nullability. *Why: redundant given per-workflow control was sufficient.*
- **Dynamic Payload-vs-Schema conformance** — `Assignment.Payload` is only validated as syntactically valid JSON. *Why: explicitly chosen "no" (N2).*
- **Pre-validation of FK existence over HTTP** — relies on Postgres FK constraint + clean error mapping; no upfront `EntityBApi` GET. *Why: chosen Option 1.*
- **`IsActive` / `Environment` gating flag on `WorkflowEntity`** — `CronExpression` nullability serves as implicit gating. *Why: explicitly declined.*
- **Soft delete** — not in v1. CRUD `DELETE` is a hard delete. *Why: unspecified; can be added later as a base concern if needed.*
- **Pagination / filtering / sorting on list endpoints** — basic `GET` returns all; complex query is out of v1. *Why: defer until proven needed.* [Tracked as v2 HTTP-17/18/19.]
- **Multiple deployable services / NuGet packaging of `BaseApi.Core`** — Option B (single API) chosen. *Why: bounded-context entities are tightly related via FKs, single team, milestone speed prioritized.* **Validated at v3.2.0 — the locked decision held; no NuGet-packaging gap emerged across 11 phases.**
- **Workflow execution result tracking / run history** — would have been `WorkflowRunEntity`; not in this model. *Why: external responsibility.*
- **OTel tracing pipeline (traces backend)** — Phase 11 D-03 supersedes OBSERV-12; no traces backend in v1 (mirrors sk2_1 CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #2). `.WithTracing()` stripped from `AddBaseApiObservability`; collector traces pipeline deleted; `TraceExportTests` deleted. *Why: no traces backend deployed in v1; revival is a future-milestone candidate when request-flow debugging becomes painful.*

## Context

- **Shipped:** v3.3.0 — 5 phases / 26 plans / 235 integration facts / ~18,344 LOC C# (7,366 src + 10,978 tests) / 237 .cs files / 158 commits (`v3.2.0..HEAD`) on 2026-05-29.
- **Shipped:** v3.2.0 — 11 phases / 41 plans / 142 integration facts / 12,321 LOC C# (5,924 src + 6,397 tests) / 190 .cs files / 334 git commits over 3 days (2026-05-26 → 2026-05-28).
- **Tech stack (locked):** .NET 8.0.421 (pinned via `global.json`), EF Core 8 + Npgsql 8.0.9, Postgres 17-alpine, StackExchange.Redis 2.13.1 + Redis 7.4.x-alpine (v3.3.0), FluentValidation 12.x, Mapperly (source-generators), OpenTelemetry .NET SDK 1.15.x with OTLP, Asp.Versioning.Http 8.1.0, Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 6.9.0, JsonSchema.Net (draft 2020-12), Cronos (5-field), Elasticsearch 8.15.5, Prometheus v3.11.3, OTel Collector contrib 0.152.0.
- **Repository structure:** `src/BaseApi.Core/` (reusable class library — 5,924 LOC including tests/, actually src/BaseApi.Core + src/BaseApi.Service split), `src/BaseApi.Service/` (the runnable webapi + Features/* per-entity folders), `tests/BaseApi.Tests/` (xUnit v3 + WebApplicationFactory + per-class throwaway Postgres DBs).
- **Test discipline:** 3-consecutive-GREEN cadence locked as the phase-close gate (Phase 3 D-18) — proven 11×. Byte-identical `psql \l` SHA-256 BEFORE/AFTER snapshot proves zero leaked `stepsdb_test_*` databases (Phase 3 D-15) — locked invariant honored across all 11 phases (most recent SHA-256: `0d98b0de57125b164489958eef5fc3da26969d18a7ef8bba845da02f20aac127`, the 4th consecutive phase to record this baseline).
- **Domain framing:** workflow / data-pipeline platform. `Schema` defines data shapes; `Processor` transforms input→output schemas (and optionally references a Config schema, per Phase 10); `Step` couples a Processor to next steps; `Assignment` binds a Step to a Payload; `Workflow` is the DAG of entry steps + assignments with an optional cron. External Orchestrator + Scheduler consume `Workflow` records to drive execution.
- **Inheritance model:** abstract generic controllers + base entity + base validators + service extensions. No `dotnet new` templates; no NuGet packaging (Option B).
- **FK relationship topology:** Schema (root) ← Processor (Input/Output/Config); Processor ← Step (+self-ref via `NextStepIds`); Step ← Assignment; Step + Assignment ← Workflow. Migration order is fixed by this graph; `InitialCreate` migration generates all 11 explicit FK constraint names matching the Phase 4 `PostgresExceptionMapper` Option A regex.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack — runtime:** .NET 8 (LTS). *Reason: user-specified.*
- **Tech stack — database:** PostgreSQL via the official Docker image. *Reason: user-specified.*
- **Tech stack — ORM:** EF Core 8 + Npgsql (`Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`). *Reason: native Guid↔uuid mapping, audit interceptor, generic repository, idiomatic for the stack.*
- **Tech stack — mapping:** Mapperly. *Reason: source-generated, zero runtime reflection, AOT-safe, modern .NET 8 standard.*
- **Tech stack — validation:** FluentValidation. *Reason: inheritable validators match the base→concrete extension pattern; SemVer regex and per-entity rules compose cleanly.*
- **Tech stack — observability:** OpenTelemetry .NET SDK with OTLP exporter. *Reason: user-specified Collector destination, vendor-neutral.*
- **Tech stack — error format:** RFC 7807 Problem Details. *Reason: built-in to ASP.NET Core, standard, machine-readable.*
- **Architecture:** Single deployable service (modular monolith). *Reason: cross-entity FKs + single-team + milestone speed; bounded-context separation by code organization, not by deployment.*
- **Persistence:** Single Postgres database, single `AppDbContext`, DB-level FK constraints. *Reason: forced by cross-entity FKs.*
- **Identity strategy:** all primary keys are `Guid`. *Reason: user-specified.*
- **Version semantics:** `Version` field is metadata (mutable in place via PUT, no `(Name, Version)` uniqueness). *Reason: user-specified.*
- **CRUD only at base:** no execution, scheduling, or business behaviors at the API surface. *Reason: scope boundary; orchestration is external.*

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Single-API (Option B) instead of 6 separate webapis | Entities have cross-entity FKs → can't isolate DBs; one team; faster milestones; can split later if needed | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — 11 phases / 41 plans / no NuGet-packaging gap |
| Shared class library `BaseApi.Core` + abstract generic controllers | Single source of infrastructure; concrete entities are pure HTTP shells | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — 5 entity feature folders are uniform 6-file shells inheriting all behavior |
| `BaseEntity` is abstract, no table; 5 concrete entities, 5 tables | Avoids inheritance-mapping complexity; clean per-entity schema | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| Single Postgres DB, single `AppDbContext` | Forced by cross-entity FK requirement | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| FK columns scalar; M2M via junction tables (no nav properties between entities) | DB-enforced integrity; minimal code coupling between entity definitions | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — 3 junction tables + 11 explicit FK constraint names |
| 3 DTOs per entity (Create / Update / Read) | Explicit separation of server-controlled fields; future-proof if Create/Update diverge | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| 3-tier layering: Controller → Service → Repository | Service is the home for entity-specific logic + M2M sync; Repository generic in base | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — `Step.SyncJunctionsAsync` + `Workflow.SyncJunctionsAsync` overrides demonstrate the seam |
| Mapperly (source-gen) over AutoMapper | Zero runtime reflection, faster, AOT-safe, modern .NET 8 idiom | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — RMG012/RMG020 drift detection proven live |
| FluentValidation over DataAnnotations | Inheritable validators; supports SemVer + per-entity composition cleanly | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| OTel exporter target = external OTel Collector via OTLP | User-specified; vendor-neutral; Collector handles backend fan-out | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — backend cutover (Phase 11) swapped logs/metrics destinations without touching the SDK side |
| `Logging:LogLevel` single source of truth for console and OTel sinks | Both sinks bind to MEL pipeline; `Logging:LogLevel` filters before either sink runs | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| `X-Correlation-Id` middleware: read or generate; attach to log scope and all responses | User-specified for log correlation; also propagates into error bodies | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — Phase 11 E2E test proves corrId round-trips through OTel to ES |
| RFC 7807 Problem Details with `correlationId` field on every error | Machine-readable, standard, ties errors to logs | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| FK pre-validation: rely on Postgres constraint + clean error mapping (Option 1) | No upfront HTTP hop to verify FK existence | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — Phase 4 PostgresExceptionMapper Option A regex held across 5 entities + 11 FK constraints |
| No dynamic Payload-vs-Schema conformance (N2 = No) | Explicit user decision; keeps validator scope bounded | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — deferred to v2 as VALID-21 |
| `Processor.SourceHash` SHA-256, unique | User-specified algorithm + uniqueness constraint | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — `uq_processor_source_hash` index in InitialCreate |
| `Processor.InputSchemaId`/`OutputSchemaId` nullable; `ConfigSchemaId` added Phase 10 | Supports source/sink/unconfigured processors; FK enforced by Postgres when non-null | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — Phase 10 symmetric addition of Config FK demonstrated the locked pattern |
| `(Name, Version)` not unique | User-specified | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| Drop `WorkflowScheduleEntity`; rely on `Workflow.CronExpression` nullability for gating | Redundant given per-workflow control was sufficient | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) |
| Migrations applied on startup by `BaseApi.Service` | Single owner of schema; no separate migration tool needed | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — Phase 8 wired `MigrateAsync` into `StartupCompletionService` with try/catch/no-rethrow contract; PERSIST-10 verified via `MigrationFailureWebAppFactory` |
| `Schema.Definition` validated as valid JSON + valid JSON Schema | User-specified | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — JsonSchema.Net draft 2020-12, SSRF-disabled (`<500ms` regression assertion) |
| `Assignment.Payload` validated as valid JSON only (not against referenced Schema) | User-specified (N2) | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — Phase 10 simplified further by dropping SchemaId from Assignment |
| Bisect-friendly N-commit sequence for v1-surface revisions (Phase 10 precedent) | Each commit isolates one concern; final commit flips test project GREEN | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — 5-commit Phase 10 sequence intact in git log; pattern adopted by Phase 11 (10 commits) |
| 3-consecutive-GREEN test cadence + byte-identical psql `\l` snapshot as phase-close gate | Proves no flakes + no leaked test DBs | ✓ Good (v3.2.0) — locked in Phase 3 D-15/D-18; honored 11× across the milestone |
| Redis is a SOFT dependency — `/health/ready` never probes it; CRUD serves 200 with Redis down (only orchestration Start/Stop fail) | Keeps the v1 CRUD surface available regardless of Redis; preserves Phase 5 HEALTH-01..05 contracts | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — `HealthDeadRedisFixture` proves both probes stay 200 with a dead Redis port |
| Iterative DFS for cycle detection (explicit stack, no recursion) | `StackOverflowException` is uncatchable by `IExceptionHandler`; recursion on adversarial graphs is unsafe | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — `CycleDetector` two-set iterative DFS |
| Strict `Schema.Id` equality for schema-edge compatibility (null-on-either-side passes) | Structural/canonical compatibility needs a subset-checker; deferred until a real use case | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — `SchemaEdgeValidator` independent edge walk |
| System.Text.Json (not Mapperly) for L2 DTO → JSON serialization | Mapperly is entity↔DTO source-gen only; L2 wire format is a flat JSON string | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — camelCase `[JsonPropertyName]`-pinned records |
| `IServer.Keys()`/`KEYS` forbidden in production; Stop uses targeted GET-and-follow traversal | Keyspace enumeration is O(N) server-blocking; graph walk by `StringGetAsync` is bounded | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — `RedisL2Cleanup` cycle-safe BFS |
| Stop = existence-gate + root/step deletion (never processor keys), non-idempotent | Scope evolved twice; processor keys self-expire via TTL and are shared across workflows | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — collect-all-missing 422, else cleanup → 204; repeated Stop → 422 |
| Per-processor keys TTL'd (`ProcessorKeyTtlDays` default 100); root/step no TTL | Processor keys outlive Stop and self-expire; root/step are deleted by Stop | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) |
| Redis `--scan` SHA-256 BEFORE=AFTER added to the phase-close gate (alongside `psql \l`) | Proves zero leaked `test:cls-*` keys; FLUSHDB forbidden (would mask leaks across parallel classes) | ✓ Good (v3.3.0) — held at 3×235 GREEN close |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state

*Last updated: 2026-05-30 — milestone v3.4.0 (BaseConsole + Orchestrator Messaging) started; Phase 17 (Messaging.Contracts + Shared L2 Root Extract) complete (MSG-CONTRACTS-01..04 + INFRA-RMQ-01); Phase 18 (BaseConsole.Core Library) complete (CONSOLE-01..05 + CONSOLE-HEALTH-01..04 + CORR-01/02; 245×3 GREEN, dual-SHA BEFORE=AFTER); Phase 19 (Orchestrator Console + WebApi Bus Wiring + RabbitMQ Tier) complete (ORCH-CON-01..04 + MSG-WEBAPI-01..04 + MSG-ACK-01..04 + INFRA-RMQ-02/03; 5/5 SC verified, live Orchestrator+RabbitMQ stack healthy; 1 human-UAT correlation-proof item deferred to Phase 20). Phase 20 (closeout) pending — milestone 3/4 phases. v3.3.0 (Orchestration L3 → L1 → L2 Build Pipeline) shipped 2026-05-29 (5 phases / 26 plans / 64 requirements / 235 facts × 3 GREEN, dual-SHA BEFORE=AFTER; milestone audit PASSED, tagged `v3.3.0`). v3.2.0 (Steps API MVP) shipped 2026-05-28. See `milestones/v3.3.0-ROADMAP.md` and `milestones/v3.2.0-ROADMAP.md` for the full phase narratives; per-phase footers preserved below for git-blame continuity.*

<summary>Historical phase footers (Phases 1-11, v3.2.0)</summary>

*2026-05-28 — Phase 11 (Migrate Prometheus and Elasticsearch from Compose Stack) complete: 10 plans / 6 waves shipped the canonical Phase-5→Phase-11 observability backend transition. Wave 1 (11-01) doc-first amendment: REQUIREMENTS.md mutates OBSERV-12 SUPERSEDED, extends INFRA-06, adds OBSERV-13/14 + INFRA-08 + TEST-07. Wave 2 (11-02 + 11-03) compose.yaml extended with elasticsearch + prometheus services; collector-config rewired (logs→ES exporter only, metrics→prometheus exporter only, no traces, no debug/file/logging). Wave 3 (11-04 + 11-05) prometheus.yml created; ObservabilityServiceCollectionExtensions stripped .WithTracing chain + 2 orphan usings; TraceExportTests + OtelEndOfSuiteCleanup + tests/.otel-out/ deleted. Wave 4 (11-06) 4 test-helper files + Wave 0 ES index probe (live index = `logs-generic.otel-default`, OTLP-normalized field shape despite mapping.mode:none deprecation). Wave 5 (11-07) SchemasLogsE2ETests + SchemasMetricsE2ETests (route-template literal http_route label per Rule 1 fix-forward). Wave 6 (11-08a/b/c) HealthEndpointsTests decoupled from OtelCollectorFixture; LogExport/LogLevelFilter/MetricsExport rewritten ES/Prom-polling; OtelCollectorFixture deleted; closing 3-GREEN cadence 163s/161s/162s at 142/142, byte-identical psql \l SHA-256 0d98b0de…0aac127. **Phase 11 COMPLETE — sk_p's observability backend mirrors sk2_1's runtime posture (logs ES, metrics Prom, no traces).***

*2026-05-28 — Phase 10 (Remove SchemaId on AssignmentEntity and add ConfigSchemaId on ProcessorEntity) complete: 5 plans / 4 waves coordinated symmetric v1-surface field-shape revision as canonical bisect-friendly 5-commit sequence (1de7e71 → 79b07d1 → 12577ac → 146d482 → 6d043e4). Wave 1 (10-01) doc-first REQUIREMENTS.md amendment. Wave 2 (10-02 + 10-03) refactor(asm) removes SchemaId from AssignmentEntity + 3 satellite files; feat(proc) adds Guid? ConfigSchemaId to ProcessorEntity + 3 DTOs + 2 validator When-blocks + lambda-less HasOne FK block (SetNull cascade, fk_processor_config_schema_id matching PostgresExceptionMapper Option A regex). Wave 3 (10-04) migration: regenerated InitialCreate in place per D-07 teardown sequence. Wave 4 (10-05) test: 10 ProcessorCreateDto/UpdateDto sites updated (SPEC said 8; runtime audit found 10), AssignmentsIntegrationTests.CreatePrereqAsync simplified Task<(Guid,Guid)> → Task<Guid>, 2 new ConfigSchemaId round-trip facts. 3-consecutive GREEN at 142/142 (29.281s/28.979s/28.869s); psql \l SHA-256 0d98b0de…0aac127 BEFORE=AFTER. **Phase 10 COMPLETE — Processor now carries 3 symmetric nullable Schema FKs (Input/Output/Config); Assignment is `(StepId, Payload)`-only.***

*2026-05-28 — Phase 9 (Processor.GetBySourceHash + Orchestration Start/Stop) complete: 3 plans / 2 waves shipped 10 source files closing Phase 9 v1 surface. (Wave 1 / 09-01) ProcessorService.GetBySourceHashAsync extends concrete service with DbContext.Set lookup + NotFoundException-on-miss; ProcessorsController.GetBySourceHash mapped to `[HttpGet("by-source-hash/{sourceHash}")]`. (Wave 1 / 09-02) New Features/Orchestration/ folder lands WorkflowIdsValidator (primitive-collection validator, auto-discovered), OrchestrationService (NOT BaseService-derived; injects BaseDbContext + IValidator + 5 mappers up-front), OrchestrationController (SINGULAR class name — first in codebase), OrchestrationServiceCollectionExtensions; both Start/Stop endpoints delegate to same ValidateWorkflowIdsAsync method returning 204 No Content. AppFeatures wired as 6th call. (Wave 2 / 09-03) 3 new test classes (GetBySourceHashFacts + StartOrchestrationFacts + StopOrchestrationFacts) covering all 6 REQ-IDs. 3-consecutive GREEN 138/138 (~29.5s); SHA-256 1C611C60…09FE5E BEFORE=AFTER. **Phase 9 COMPLETE.***

*2026-05-28 — Phase 8 (Entity Build-Out + Migrations + Docker + Runtime Tests) complete: 8 plans / 4 waves shipped 53 source files spanning 5 v1 entities + 3 junctions + InitialCreate migration + multistage Dockerfile + AppDbContext composition + 30 new integration facts. (Wave 1 / 08-01) Foundation: multistage Dockerfile + .dockerignore, compose.yaml build mutation, dotnet-ef 8.0.27 pinned, 4 packages added (JsonSchema.Net, Cronos, Riok.Mapperly, EFCore.Design), Phase8WebAppFactory, TEST-03/TEST-04 deferred to v2. (Wave 2 / 08-02..08-06) 5 entity feature folders following uniform Schema-feature-folder layout. Step + Workflow override BaseService.SyncJunctionsAsync. (Wave 3 / 08-07) AppDbContext populated with 8 DbSets, AppFeatures aggregator keeps Program.cs at 8 non-trivial body lines. StartupCompletionService body-swapped to MigrateAsync-at-startup with try/catch/LogCritical/no-rethrow/no-MarkReady contract (PERSIST-10). InitialCreate migration: 8 CreateTable, 11 explicit FK constraint names. (Wave 4 / 08-08) ErrorMappingFacts (4 cross-entity error-mapping facts) + MigrationFailureWebAppFactory + MigrationFailureFacts (PERSIST-10 — /health/live=200 while /health/startup=503 & /health/ready=503). 3-consecutive GREEN 128/128. **v1 milestone shippable: 39 active REQ-IDs satisfied; 8/8 phases complete.***

*2026-05-27 — Phase 7 (Generic HTTP Base + Composition Root) complete: 18 new BaseApi.Core source files + Program.cs cutover land the abstract generic composition root. IHasId marker; abstract BaseController + BaseService; CONTEXT D-13 amendment — observability split to `IHostApplicationBuilder.AddBaseApiObservability` (needs ILoggingBuilder). AuditInterceptor lifetime reconciled as Singleton (Phase 3 D-06). UseBaseApi() enforces D-19 pipeline order. Program.cs is 7 non-trivial body lines (cap: 10). 98/98 facts GREEN × 3 consecutive runs (76 prior + 22 new). 9 REQ-IDs closed. Manual Swagger UI smoke resolved via SwaggerEnvironmentFacts (Dev 200 / Prod 404) — v1 BaseApi.Service has zero concrete controllers, so live-boot empty UI is structurally expected.*

*2026-05-27 — Phase 6 (Validation + Mapping Base) complete: 5 BaseApi.Core seam files. Mapperly RMG007/RMG012/RMG020/RMG089 promoted to solution-wide build errors (MP-codes corrected to RMG-codes per RESEARCH A-01). WebAppFactory unsealed. 76/76 GREEN × 3 consecutive runs. Drift-detection proven LIVE on all 3 mapper methods. 8 REQ-IDs closed. Plan-gap fix-forward: Phase 8 must replicate 3-method [MapperIgnoreTarget]/[MapperIgnoreSource] attribute pattern across all 5 entity mappers.*

*2026-05-27 — Phase 5 (Observability + Health Probes) complete: OTel wired via MEL bridge (never WithLogging per Pitfall 8) + services-chain metrics+traces + bare AddNpgsql() (no callback per RESEARCH-corrected D-05 / Reconciliation 1) + dual resource builders (service.name=sk-api, service.version=3.2.0). Three K8s-style health probes with strict tag discipline (live → only "self", never DB per Pitfall 15). IStartupGate + StartupCompletionService. otel-collector Docker Compose service with OTLP gRPC :4317 + HTTP :4318 + file exporter to bind-mounted tests/.otel-out/ + filter/health_metrics processor (OTTL IsMatch on http.route). 47/47 GREEN × 3 consecutive runs. 14 REQ-IDs closed. [Note: Phase 5 file-exporter infrastructure retired by Phase 11; OBSERV-12 superseded.]*

*2026-05-27 — Phase 4 (Cross-Cutting Middleware + Error Handling) complete: CorrelationIdMiddleware + .NET 8 IExceptionHandler chain (NotFound→Validation→DbUpdate→Fallback per D-06; DbUpdateExceptionHandler concurrency-FIRST per Pitfall 7) + PostgresExceptionMapper (Option A regex preserving `_id` suffix, SQLSTATE 23503→422 / 23505→409) + Program.cs composition root with AddProblemDetails customizer. 31/31 facts GREEN over real Postgres 17. 14 REQ-IDs closed. Threat model verified: T-04-LEAK / T-04-XMIN / T-04-INJECT all PASS. Npgsql pinned at 8.0.9 (binary-compat with EFCore.PostgreSQL 8.0.10 — fix-forward from initial 9.0.0 pin).*

*2026-05-27 — Phase 3 (EF Core Persistence Base) complete: BaseEntity + BaseDbContext (abstract, snake_case + xmin shadow concurrency token) + AuditInterceptor (TimeProvider-based, null-safe HttpContext) + IRepository/Repository (sealed generic, 5-method surface, load-then-remove DeleteAsync); 7/7 facts GREEN against real Postgres 17; zero leaked stepsdb_test_* databases; D-11 (no Program.cs touch) and D-16 (no migrations) both honored — Phase 8 owns first migration so snake_case + xmin apply to the very first schema.*
